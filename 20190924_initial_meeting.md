# Meeting Notes

Met with Darrin and Jen

Discussed new ideas on how to get more data out of the electrodes

DC30 ideas:

    Alien Ears with lights and screens to show current mood

    Detect current mood and display it somewhere
    Open to anything

    Double-blind data-collection with tDCS to validate data collection match the expected outcome

    How data is shared from devices to the public

    Integrate other biometrics that users might have

    EEG Integrated Device

    All in one device including multiple biometric scanners a nd develop a baseline, so we can respond to changes away from desired baseline state
        Inputs:
            EEG
            Temperature
            Heart rate

        Outputs: 
            tDCS
            aural stim
    
    Standalone device for this: https://www.mindamend.com/brainwave-entrainment/binaural-beats-vs-isochronic-tones/

    Contest for who can change their brain state/bio-state the most

    Here's how the IO and readings and controls work, and said "what can you do with it?"
