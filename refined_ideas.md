Date | Author | Idea | Description
-|-|-|-
20190924 | Aask | Alien Mood-Springs | Alien ears which read data from users brain and react in real time with either a display or other kind of indication of mental state
20190924 | Aask | Electropaque Glass | Acrylic glass that changes opacity depending on last biometric readings from user
20191003 | Aask | What Addon? | Ultra-black Add-on with zirconia in the center to make it look like a shaped void
20191003 | Aask | Linecon | Badge with 2 buttons and 4 LEDs for selecting mode, and maybe a 7 segment display. Would need an accelerometer to track how long users stood in place vs how many floors they rode on the escalator vs elevator, how many steps they took, etc. Lots of stats from a simple accelerometer, would also benefit from a web interface of some kind on captive portal (if we can stabilize that sucker)
20191003 | Razzies & Aask | Insulin Pump for your Brain | Dynamically respond to EEG readings with double blind tDCS as well as display mood to the outside world with LED array. Passively it will have a "Super Dark" mask on it. Simplified to attention. Could be a crown, headband, or whatever we want to do.
